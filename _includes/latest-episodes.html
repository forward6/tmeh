       <h3>Episode 20: The Employee of the Multiverse Awards!</h3>
       <p>Join us for our first (and possibly last, depending on which timeline you're observing) multiversal awards ceremony! Watch as our newly philosophical automated response system hosts an evening of quantum achievements, where every award exists in a superposition of success and "needs improvement" until observed. Plus, find out if Dave from Accounting ever finishes his time-dilated lunch break, why the office ficus deserves "Best Supporting Foliage," and what happens when someone tries to give an acceptance speech across infinite realities!</p>

       <h3>Episode 19: The Science of Interstellar, Plus it's Christmas!</h3>
       <p>Join us for a festive exploration of interstellar physics as we celebrate both the 10th anniversary of Christopher Nolan's "Interstellar" and the holiday season! Find out why Kip Thorne's wormholes make time dilation look easy compared to escaping the office holiday party, discover how gravitational physics affects Santa's delivery schedule, and learn why "love transcending dimensions" might be more scientifically plausible than the office printer working on the first try.</p>
