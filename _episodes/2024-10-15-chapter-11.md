When a company goes broke in every possible reality simultaneously, bankruptcy becomes less about restructuring debt and more about restructuring the fabric of spacetime itself. Today we explore what happens when your assets exist in a superposition of profit and loss.

## Key Topics Covered
* How to file for bankruptcy across multiple universes
* Quantum superposition of assets and liabilities
* The physics of financial collapse
* When debt achieves quantum coherence

## The Quantum Economics of Failure
In the multiverse, every company is simultaneously successful and bankrupt until investors collapse the wave function. Our automated response system calculates the probability of solvency across infinite realities.

## Signs Your Company Has Gone Quantum Broke
Common symptoms include:
* Assets existing in multiple states simultaneously
* Balance sheets that change when observed
* Debt achieving quantum tunneling
* Profit margins in non-Euclidean space

## Requirements for Quantum Bankruptcy
1. Understanding of quantum economics
2. Multiversal legal representation
3. Reality-stable financial records
4. Quantum-proof accounting software

## Managing Multiversal Insolvency
* Always specify which universe you're bankrupt in
* Keep assets quantum coherent
* Never create temporal paradoxes in the books
* Accept that some debt exists only in theory

* "Why Your Bankruptcy Created a New Universe"
* "Schrödinger's Balance Sheet: A CFO's Manual"
* "Debt Restructuring Across the Multiverse"

Remember: Just because you're broke in this universe doesn't mean you're not
successful in another. Some bankruptcies are best left in quantum superposition!
