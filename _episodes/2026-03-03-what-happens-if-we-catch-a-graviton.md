description: >
  Gravity has been operating continuously, without maintenance, since 
  approximately 13.8 billion years ago. It governs every planet, every orbit, 
  every falling object in the history of the cosmos. It also, embarrassingly, 
  still hasn't confirmed its own carrier particle. Every other fundamental force 
  has one. Gravity has provided waves — Nobel Prize-winning, LIGO-confirmed 
  waves — but the particle riding those waves, the graviton, remains the most 
  wanted and most elusive entry in the whole of fundamental physics. Today we 
  ask: how do you catch something that makes a whisper look deafening? And 
  what happens to physics if you do?

The universe operates through four fundamental forces. Three of them have 
confirmed carrier particles, documented, measured, and accounted for. 
The fourth — gravity — has been doing its job for 13.8 billion years without 
submitting the relevant paperwork.

This is the story of the graviton: why we're certain it must exist, why catching 
one makes every other experiment in physics look straightforward, and why a 
cylinder of beryllium cooled to near absolute zero might be the most consequential 
object currently sitting in a laboratory.

## The Chain of Discovery

The pendulum told us gravity was a field. Maxwell told us fields travel in waves. 
Einstein told us gravity ripples. LIGO confirmed the ripple. Quantum mechanics 
insists the ripple must have a particle.

The logic is almost insultingly straightforward. The experiment is anything but.

## Why It's So Hard

Gravity is catastrophically weak on the quantum scale. A small fridge magnet 
can defeat the gravitational pull of the entire Earth to lift a paperclip. Freeman 
Dyson calculated that a detector the size of Jupiter orbiting a neutron star would 
catch roughly one graviton per decade.

Scientists have recently stopped thinking about Jupiter-sized detectors.

## What's Actually Being Tried

Right now, teams are cooling beryllium bars and superfluid helium to the edge 
of absolute zero, using LIGO as a cosmic starting gun, and watching the Large 
Hadron Collider for energy that simply vanishes into extra dimensions. We are, 
physicists will tell you with barely contained excitement, in the same position 
relative to gravity that physics was in 1905 relative to light — just before 
Einstein proved light came in particles.

Finding the graviton wouldn't just fill a gap in the catalogue. It would be the 
first experimental bridge between quantum mechanics and general relativity — 
the two great theories of physics that each work perfectly and refuse, 
so far, to work together.

Gravity has been getting away with this for long enough.

*The beryllium is cooling. LIGO is listening. Two black holes somewhere in 
the cosmos are helpfully circling each other. We just need to be quiet enough 
to hear what arrives.*
