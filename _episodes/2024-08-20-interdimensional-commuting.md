Navigate the cosmic commute conundrum with our guide to wormhole etiquette and temporal traffic management. Learn why "I got stuck in a time dilation field" isn't a valid excuse for being late, and discover the art of quantum parking.

> **Traffic Notice**: This episode exists in all possible commuting states until
> someone observes your arrival time.

## Key Topics Covered
* Proper wormhole navigation protocols
* Managing temporal traffic jams
* Quantum parking strategies
* When commutes break causality

## The Quantum Commuter
In the multiverse, every journey simultaneously takes no time and infinite time until observed by your manager. Our automated response system calculates the probability of on-time arrival across realities.

> "The moment someone opened a wormhole shortcut to work, I knew we needed
> better interdimensional traffic regulations."

> — Dr. Max Planck III, Chief Transit Officer

## Signs Your Commute Has Gone Quantum
Common symptoms include:
* Travel times achieving uncertainty
* Routes quantum tunneling between realities
* Traffic existing in multiple states
* Parking spots in non-Euclidean space

> **Warning**: Commuting across parallel universes may result in temporal
> paradoxes, quantum entanglement, and infinite traffic delays.

## Requirements for Quantum Commuting
1. Understanding of space-time navigation
2. Reality-stable transportation
3. Quantum-proof GPS systems
4. Interdimensional parking permits

## Managing Multiversal Travel
* Always verify which universe you're heading to
* Keep your route quantum coherent
* Never create temporal paradoxes in traffic
* Accept that some commutes exist only in theory

> **Transit Notice**: Due to quantum uncertainty, all arrival times are
> simultaneously early and late until observed.

## Further Reading
* "The Quantum Guide to Traffic Management"
* "Why Your Shortcut Created a New Timeline"
* "Schrödinger's Commute: A Driver's Manual"
* "Parking Across the Multiverse"

Remember: Just because your commute is quick in this universe doesn't mean
it's not gridlocked in another. Some journeys are best left in quantum
superposition!
