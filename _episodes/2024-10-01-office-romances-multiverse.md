## Episode Summary
Dating your coworkers becomes exponentially more complicated when you have to consider quantum entanglement and parallel universe protocols. Today we explore why "it's complicated" doesn't begin to describe office romance in the multiverse.

> **HR Notice**: This episode has been reviewed by HR departments across infinite
> realities. All have different opinions about appropriate workplace relationships.

## Key Topics Covered
* HR guidelines for dating your alternate self
* The quantum mechanics of office crushes
* How to break up when you're quantumly entangled
* When flirting violates causality

## The Quantum Romance
When office romance meets quantum mechanics, every relationship simultaneously exists and doesn't exist until HR observes it. Our automated response system calculates the probability of success across infinite realities.

> "The moment we discovered quantum entanglement could affect workplace
> relationships, office dating policies had to be rewritten across all possible
> timelines."

## Signs Your Office Romance Has Gone Quantum
Common symptoms include:
* Relationships existing in multiple states
* Dating yourself from another universe
* Love triangles in non-Euclidean space
* Break-up paradoxes across timelines

> **Warning**: Dating across parallel universes may result in temporal
> paradoxes, quantum entanglement, and awkward holiday parties.

## Requirements for Quantum Dating
1. Understanding of parallel universe protocols
2. Quantum-stable emotional states
3. Reality-proof relationship agreements
4. Paradox-aware HR department

## Managing Multiversal Relationships
* Always verify which universe your date is from
* Keep entanglement professional
* Never create temporal paradoxes while flirting
* Accept that some relationships exist only in theory

> **Dating Notice**: Due to quantum uncertainty, all relationships are
> simultaneously professional and personal until HR investigates.

Remember: Just because you're dating in this universe doesn't mean you're
single in another. Some relationships are best left in quantum superposition!
