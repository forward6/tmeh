 When the marketing department is tasked with making dark comets trendy, our first interstellar visitor becomes an unwitting social media influencer.

Journey into the intersection of astronomical mystery and corporate branding, where invisible objects meet impossible marketing demands. Watch as the Square-Haired Boss attempts to make dark comets millennial-friendly, and discover why some cosmic phenomena resist even the most aggressive social media strategies.

> **Warning**: Any attempt to schedule a TikTok collaboration with an interstellar object moving at 26 kilometers per second may result in temporal whiplash.

## The Invisible Influencer
In the fluorescent-lit reality of Quantum Dynamics Inc., the marketing department faces its greatest challenge yet: making dark comets relatable to Gen Z. Armed with nothing but astronomical data and a mood board featuring rocks in sunglasses, they're about to learn that some things in the universe refuse to be branded – no matter how many black turtlenecks you photoshop onto them.

## Signs Your Comet Has Gone Corporate
Watch for these warning signs that your astronomical object might be suffering from excessive marketing: Unexplained acceleration attributed to viral momentum, mysterious signals interpreted as engagement metrics, and enigmatic behavior labeled as "playing hard to get." If your interstellar visitor starts ghosting the entire solar system, it may be time to reassess your social media strategy.

> **Meeting Notice**: All future brainstorming sessions will be held in non-Euclidean space to accommodate expanding market demographics.

## A Brief Guide to Astronomical Marketing
For those brave enough to attempt branding the unknowable, remember these essential tips:
1. Dark comets don't check their Instagram mentions
2. Interstellar objects can't be influenced by follower counts
3. Some things are undetectable - like your target audience's actual engagement

## Breaking News from Space
While marketing was busy trying to make 'Oumuamua go viral, astronomers have been gathering actual data about our mysterious visitor. Initial observations suggested it was either cigar-shaped or pancake-like, tumbling through space at 26 kilometers per second while subtly accelerating in ways that challenge our understanding of physics.

The object's unusual characteristics have led to theories ranging from hydrogen ice to alien light sails, proving that sometimes reality is stranger than any marketing campaign could invent. Current models suggest there could be at least one 'Oumuamua-sized object within Earth's orbit at any given time – they're just better at avoiding social media than we thought.

> **Note**: Any attempts to boost dark comet engagement through artificial acceleration will be met with both astronomical skepticism and violation of orbital mechanics.

Remember: In the grand marketing campaign of existence, sometimes the most engaging content is the content we can't see – though that makes metrics rather challenging to track.
