Welcome to your first day at Infinite Incorporated! Navigate the complexities of interdimensional corporate culture as we explore the basics of dimensionality, proper quantum workplace etiquette, and why the break room exists in a superposition of states until someone checks the fridge.

{: .callout}
> **Orientation Notice**: This training session simultaneously exists and doesn't exist
> until HR processes your paperwork.

## Key Topics Covered
* Understanding dimensional basics
* Office navigation in non-Euclidean space
* Proper quantum etiquette
* Break room quantum mechanics

## The Flatland Promotion
Meet Euclidea, a humble square from Flatland who received an unexpected promotion to manage a 3D department. Learn from her journey of adaptation and discovery as she navigates the challenges of leading across dimensions.

> "Sometimes thinking outside the box means realizing there is no box -
> just an infinite series of dimensional possibilities."
>
> — Euclidea, Interdimensional Manager

## Signs You're In The Wrong Dimension
Common indicators include:
* Your desk exists in four dimensions
* The coffee machine dispenses probability waves
* Your coworkers are simultaneously there and not there
* The org chart loops in on itself

{: .callout}
> **Warning**: Attempting to understand all dimensions simultaneously may result in
> temporal vertigo, existential uncertainty, and paradoxical paperwork.

## Requirements for Interdimensional Employment
1. Ability to perceive multiple realities
2. Comfort with quantum uncertainty
3. Non-Euclidean space awareness
4. Tolerance for temporal paradoxes

## Managing Multiversal Work Life
* Always verify which dimension you're in
* Keep your quantum states coherent
* Never create causality loops in meetings
* Accept that some tasks exist only in theory

{: .callout}
> **HR Notice**: Due to quantum uncertainty, your employment status is
> simultaneously active and inactive until observed.

## Further Reading
* "The Beginner's Guide to Dimensional Management"
* "Why Your Desk Is Bigger on the Inside"
* "Schrödinger's Employee Handbook"
* "Meeting Minutes Across Spacetime"

Remember: Just because something makes sense in your home dimension doesn't mean
it translates across the multiverse. Some concepts are best left in quantum
superposition!
