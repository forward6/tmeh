## Episode Summary
When your performance is being evaluated across all possible realities simultaneously, "meets expectations" becomes a quantum state rather than a rating. Today we explore why annual reviews are even more terrifying when they exist in infinite dimensions.

> **HR Notice**: This episode simultaneously exceeds and fails to meet
> expectations until observed by management.

## Key Topics Covered
* How to evaluate infinite versions of yourself
* The quantum superposition of career goals
* When salary negotiations break causality
* Setting achievable goals across parallel universes

## The Quantum Review
In the multiverse, every performance metric exists in all possible states until your manager collapses the wave function. Our automated response system calculates your probability of promotion across infinite realities.

> "The moment we implemented quantum performance metrics, every employee
> became simultaneously the best and worst performer in the company."
>
> — Dr. Max Planck III, Director of Quantum HR

## Signs Your Review Has Gone Quantum
Common symptoms include:
* Ratings existing in multiple states
* Goals achieving quantum uncertainty
* Salary bands in non-Euclidean space
* Performance paradoxes across timelines

> **Warning**: Attempting to measure both performance and potential
> simultaneously may violate Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

## Requirements for Quantum Reviews
1. Understanding of parallel performance states
2. Quantum-stable evaluation metrics
3. Reality-proof goal setting
4. Multiversal compensation plans

## Managing Infinite Evaluations
* Always specify which universe you're evaluating
* Keep metrics quantum coherent
* Never create temporal paradoxes in KPIs
* Accept that some achievements exist only in theory

{: .callout}
> **Review Notice**: Due to quantum uncertainty, all performance ratings are
> simultaneously excellent and poor until observed.

Remember: Just because you're underperforming in this universe doesn't mean
you're not CEO in another. Some achievements are best left in quantum
superposition!
