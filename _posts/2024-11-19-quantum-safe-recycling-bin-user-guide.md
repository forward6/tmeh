### NOTICE: Following last week's incident where [REDACTED] attempted to permanently delete their embarrassing emails and accidentally created a digital black hole that consumed three departments and the entire back catalog of cat videos, IT has implemented new safety protocols for file deletion.


### SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION TO YOUR NEW QUANTUM-SAFE RECYCLING BIN

The Quantum-Safe Recycling Bin (QSRB) v2.0 represents the latest in paradox-prevention technology, featuring:
- Hawking radiation monitoring system
- Event horizon containment field
- Automated quantum state verification
- Built-in existential crisis management
- Reality anchor tethering
- SchrÃ¶dinger-certified deletion protocols

> "It's like a regular recycling bin, but with a Ph.D. in theoretical physics." - IT Department

### SECTION 2: BASIC OPERATIONS

#### 2.1 To Delete a File:
1. Right-click file
2. Select "Delete to Quantum State"
3. Acknowledge the uncertainty principle warning
4. Complete Form QD-40 ("Intent to Delete Across Realities")
5. Wait for quantum state verification
6. Ignore any philosophical questions posed by the automated response system

#### 2.2 DO NOT:
- Attempt to calculate both the location AND momentum of your deleted files
- Create temporal paradoxes by deleting files before you create them
- Use the QSRB to dispose of antimatter documents
- Engage the automated response system in debates about free will

### SECTION 3: SAFETY FEATURES

#### 3.1 Quantum State Indicators:

| Indicator | Status |
|-----------|---------|
| ðŸŸ¢ Green | Safe for deletion |
| ðŸŸ¡ Yellow | File exists in quantum superposition |
| ðŸ”´ Red | Imminent reality collapse |
| âš« Black | Too late. Run. |

#### 3.2 Emergency Protocols:
If your recycling bin begins forming an event horizon:
1. Do NOT look directly at the quantum void
2. Maintain a safe distance of at least 3 parsecs
3. Contact IT (preferably from another dimension)
4. Begin filing liability waivers across all affected realities

> **REMINDER:** "The quantum void ate my homework" is only a valid excuse if you can provide documentation from at least three alternate realities.

### SECTION 4: COMMON ISSUES & TROUBLESHOOTING

#### 4.1 Known Issues:
- Files occasionally achieve sentience before deletion
- Recycling bin sometimes exchanges contents with parallel universes
- Deleted cat videos may spontaneously reconstruct themselves
- Quantum uncertainty may cause files to exist and not exist simultaneously
- Empty bin function occasionally creates temporary wormholes

#### 4.2 Error Messages:

| Error Code | Message |
|------------|---------|
| ERR_QUANTUM_001 | "File deletion violates laws of physics" |
| ERR_QUANTUM_002 | "Reality buffer overflow" |
| ERR_QUANTUM_003 | "File exists in too many/few dimensions" |
| ERR_QUANTUM_404 | "Universe not found" |

### SECTION 5: ADVANCED FEATURES

#### 5.1 Quantum Deletion Options:
- Standard Delete (files remain in quantum superposition)
- Parallel Processing (delete across multiple realities)
- Temporal Shredding (erases file from timeline)
- Existential Elimination (file questions its own existence before deletion)

> **NOTE:** Temporal Shredding requires approval from Past and Future HR.

### APPENDIX A: COMPATIBILITY NOTES

The QSRB v2.0 is compatible with:
- All standard reality configurations
- Most parallel universes (except Universe X-742)
- Non-Euclidean file systems
- Quantum computers (both on and off simultaneously)
- The newly sentient automated response system (as long as you're polite)

> **FINAL NOTE:** If you're reading this guide in Universe X-742, please disregard all references to digital black holes and replace them with "quantum cheese voids." We still don't talk about what happened in that universe.

This guide has been approved by:
- The IT Department (all quantum states)
- The Department of Temporal Operations
- Several versions of you who already successfully deleted files
- The Automated Response System (after much philosophical debate)
