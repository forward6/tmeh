### NOTICE: This celebration exists in a superposition of states until observed by the party planning committee.


In a delightful quantum coincidence that would make even Schrödinger's cat do a double-take, December 5th marks the birth of three remarkable figures across our multiverse: Werner Heisenberg (1901), Walt Disney (1901), and the fictional Walter White (birth year uncertain, probably watching us right now).

### A Tale of Three Heisenbergs

#### Werner "I'm Fairly Certain This is My Birthday" Heisenberg:
- Invented quantum uncertainty, making it impossible to know both where your birthday party is AND how fun it will be
- Proved that electrons don't actually orbit nuclei, they just kind of vibe around them
- Made particle physics more confusing than a Disney plot involving time travel

#### Walt "Making Magic Measurable" Disney:
- Created a mouse that defies both physics and pants-wearing conventions
- Built a kingdom where fantasy and reality merge like quantum states
- Somehow made "It's a Small World" exist in all possible universes simultaneously

#### Walter "I Am The One Who Knocks" White:
- High school chemistry teacher who took Heisenberg's name and Disney's entrepreneurial spirit to... questionable places
- Achieved 99.1% purity while maintaining uncertainty about his moral compass
- Proved that bald men in pork pie hats should not be trusted with extensive knowledge of chemistry

> "I am uncertain about this collaboration." - Werner Heisenberg, upon learning he shares a birthday with both the creator of Mickey Mouse and his future criminal namesake

### Interdimensional Celebration Guidelines

#### Approved Party Activities:
- Quantum Piñata (simultaneously broken and intact until observed)
- Pin the Uncertainty on the Electron
- Musical Chairs with Quantum Superposition (everyone wins AND loses)
- Disney Karaoke in Wave Functions
- Breaking Bad-themed chemistry demonstrations (non-toxic varieties only)

#### Prohibited Activities:
- Attempting to precisely measure both the party's location and momentum
- Using the quantum coffee machine to make "special" blue coffee
- Teaching mice about quantum tunneling (Mickey is enough trouble already)
- Knocking when nobody's actually there

### Multiverse Party Planning Notes

#### Reality Convergence Points:
- Universe P-Br: Where Walt Disney and Werner Heisenberg co-created "Quantum Mickey"
- Universe Ba-56: Where Walter White became a Disney Imagineer instead
- Universe ∆x∆p: Where uncertainty is so high, nobody knows whose birthday it actually is

> **REMINDER:** In at least one universe, "Let It Go" is actually about releasing quantum particles from observation. We don't visit that universe anymore.

### Special Interdimensional Menu
- Schrödinger's Birthday Cake (both chocolate and vanilla until sliced)
- Mickey Mouse-shaped Uncertainty Principles
- Blue Crystal Candy (approved by HR, surveilled by DEA)
- Quantum Punch (see previous safety guidelines)

> "You're goddamn right it's my birthday too." - Walter White, probably

> **Note:** If you're in Universe X-742, where everything is cheese-based, please disregard this entire memo. We still don't talk about that universe.
