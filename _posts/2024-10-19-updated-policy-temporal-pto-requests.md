### NOTICE: This policy update affects all employees across all temporal planes.
Please ensure all versions of yourself are aware of these changes.

Effective immediately, all requests for Temporal Paid Time Off (TPTO) must be submitted both retrospectively and prospectively. Due to recent temporal paradox incidents, we're implementing stricter guidelines to maintain timeline coherence and prevent unauthorized vacation duplications.

---

### New Submission Process

To request Temporal PTO, employees must now follow these steps:

1. Submit your request to Future-HR at least two weeks ahead of your intended time off.
2. Obtain approval from Past-HR confirming that you have already taken the time off successfully.
3. Have your present self verify that both approvals align with current timeline regulations.
4. Submit temporal coherence verification forms to all three temporal branches of HR.

> *"Remember, if your future self hasn't approved your past self's vacation request, your present self can't take the time off that your past self already enjoyed."*
> â€” Sandra Martinez, Chief Temporal Officer

### Important Changes

- Maximum of three temporal versions of yourself can be on vacation simultaneously.
- Vacation paradox insurance is now mandatory for all TPTO requests.
- Time loops longer than 72 hours require executive approval.
- No vacation requests during known temporal anomalies or timeline mergers.

---

### Paradox Prevention Guidelines

To prevent temporal vacation paradoxes, please observe the following guidelines:

- **Do not attempt to vacation with past or future versions of yourself without proper paperwork.**
- **Avoid creating infinite vacation loops** by repeatedly sending yourself back to the start of your time off.
- **If you encounter another version of yourself on vacation, do not share upcoming timeline information.**
- **Keep your temporal displacement device with you at all times during TPTO.**

> **REMINDER:** Unauthorized temporal duplication of vacation days is strictly prohibited and may result in retroactive disciplinary action across multiple timelines.
