> **ALERT**: Scheduled maintenance will affect all interdimensional printing services this weekend. Please plan accordingly and complete essential cross-dimensional printing before Friday at 17:00 SMT (Standard Multiverse Time).

The Interdimensional IT Department will be performing critical maintenance on the quantum network infrastructure that supports our cross-dimensional printing capabilities. This maintenance is necessary to prevent issues like last month's incident where the entire Q-sector received everyone's print jobs in triplicate and printed them using infinite paper.

## Maintenance Schedule

* **Start**: Friday, October 21, 18:00 SMT  
* **End**: Monday, October 24, 06:00 SMT
* **Duration**: 60 hours (accounting for temporal dilation)
* **Affected Dimensions**: All except Emergency Dimension E-12

## Expected Impact

During the maintenance window, users may experience the following:

* Random materialization of documents in unexpected dimensions
* Temporary reversal of text direction and/or chronology
* Quantum paper jams that exist in multiple states simultaneously
* Brief periods where printers may become sentient
* Occasional temporal echoes of previous print jobs

## Contingency Measures

For urgent printing needs during the maintenance window:

1. Emergency Dimension E-12 printers will remain operational (clearance level 3 required).
2. The retro-analog printer in the basement of Timeline A still works with standard paper.
3. Interdimensional courier services will be available for critical document delivery.
4. Telepathic document transmission remains unaffected (where licensed).

> **IMPORTANT**: Please do not attempt to fix quantum paper jams yourself. Our maintenance team is certified in handling documents existing in quantum superposition.

## Post-Maintenance Benefits

Following this maintenance, users can expect:

* 50% faster cross-dimensional document transmission
* Improved quantum color calibration
* Reduced probability of accidental document time travel
* New support for non-Euclidean paper formats
* Enhanced reality-stabilization for printed materials

## Preparation Guidelines

Before maintenance begins:

1. Complete all pending print jobs.
2. Save quantum toner by printing in mono-dimensional mode when possible.
3. Back up important documents to your local timeline.
4. Update your quantum printer drivers to version ∞.2.7.
